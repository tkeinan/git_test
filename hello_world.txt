Here's a neat cheat sheet for git that I've uploaded to the repo

## Commands related to a remote repository:

## copy the repo onto your local storage
git clone git@github.com:USER-NAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git

## whoami @tkeinan/git_test.git *for now*

## send commits out to main
git push

## add the directory to the staging area
git add .

## 
git commit -m "A message describing what you have done to make this snapshot different"

## Commands related to checking status or log history
git status

## have a look at changes made to the repository
git log

-------------------------------------------------------
The basic Git syntax is program | action | destination.

Example:
git add . is read as git | add | ., where the period represents everything in the current directory;
git commit -m "message" is read as git | commit -m | "message"; and
git status is read as git | status | (no destination).
